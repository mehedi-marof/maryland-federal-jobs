                <p>State officials are decrying new federal jobs numbers that show Maryland lost more than 10,000
                    federal jobs over two months at the end of last year, bringing the total jobs lost for the year to
                    25,000.</p>

                <p>The report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that Maryland lost more federal jobs since
                    President Donald Trump took office than any other state in the nation. In sharp remarks Wednesday
                    directed at the Republican administration in Washington, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said Washington has
                    “broken its pact” with Maryland and with the country.</p>

                <p>“Donald Trump ran on a premise that he alone could fix it,” Moore said during the Board of Public
                    Works meeting Wednesday. “What he didn’t tell the American people was that he alone could break it,
                    and the policies that we continue to see from this White House have continued to make all of our
                    lives harder.”</p>

                <p>The updated figures reflect job loses from October and November, when the so-called “fork in the
                    road” job buyout took effect, for federal employees who were given the opportunity earlier in the
                    year to resign and receive full pay and benefits until the end of September. State officials said it
                    would be not be until after the deadline when the impact of those decisions would start to be seen.

                <p>Federal jobs represent about 6% of the state’s total employment and 10% of the state’s overall wages.
                </p>

                <p>“As I said, months into the new Trump-Vance administration, what is happening to the state of
                    Maryland that these are not lancing blows. These are direct shots. They are direct shots that are
                    impacting every single corner of our state,” Moore said.</p>

                <p>The numbers released Wednesday do not come as a surprise. The Board of Revenue Estimates last March
                    projected a reduction of as many as 28,000 federal jobs in the state.</p>

                <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/27806195"></div>

                <p>“The numbers are incredibly concerning for a number of reasons,” said Comptroller Brooke Lierman.
                    “One, because they represent not a thoughtful approach to making government more efficient, but a
                    whack-a-mole attack on important federal services.”</p>

                <p>Maryland Labor Secretary Portia Wu called the report “sobering.”</p>

                <p>“Unfortunately, they are something we have been discussing, and we have known that this would be
                    coming, and that these would be the first monthly job numbers to reflect the fork in the road,” she
                    said.</p>

                <p>Wu cautioned that the numbers, which are in line with earlier state estimates, could get worse
                    because some federal employees “took different versions” of the fork in the road.</p>

                <p>“There were individuals, for example, that took some form of deferred retirement or early
                    retirement,” Wu said Wednesday. “Those individuals would have concluded employment at the end of
                    December or perhaps in early January, depending on their retirement. So I think we do anticipate
                    there will be additional sets of numbers and additional impacts.”</p>

                <p>Moore touted the resiliency of the state economy including a 4.2% unemployment figure he said is
                    below the 4.6% national rate.</p>

                <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/27808921"></div>

                <p>The state has historically benefited from its symbiotic relationship with the federal government.
                    High-paying jobs and federal contracting have often meant the state entered recessionary periods
                    slower. Now that exposure is proving to be a potential weakness.</p>

                <p>In September, the state’s unemployment rate rose two-tenths of a percent to 3.8%.</p>

                <p>The current unemployment rate cited by Moore is higher than the 3.0% rate in January 2023, the month
                    Moore was sworn in. It’s also higher than 3.3% in February 2020, before the start of the COVID 19
                    pandemic.</p>

                <p>Wu said there has not been a dramatic bump in unemployment claims, but called that metric “a lagging
                    indicator.”</p>

                <p>Wu also cautioned that some Maryland residents may have been federal employees in the District of
                    Columbia or Virginia, both of which were also hit hard with job reductions. Those employees would
                    file for unemployment benefits in the state where they were employed.</p>
